        "fullContent": "<p>Research project exploring governance frameworks for AI agents as autonomous economic actors. The project focuses on the 'Permeable Membrane' framework that models the boundary between agent and human economies as a set of distinct Gates (legal, financial, infrastructural) through which specific Objects (capital, liability, data, energy) can flow. The concern motivating this work is that without intentional design, this membrane will be defined by reactive interventions as agents scale, locking in a system shaped by market pressures rather than deliberate choices. The project aims to build frameworks to inform and enable a range of governance solutions, identify knowledge gaps in agent-human economic interfaces, operationalize specific Gates within the Permeable Membrane, and increase optionality in governance design. Research directions include conceptual research on how Gates relate to AI-related risks, empirical research through simulations, and building technical governance platforms that increase governability while remaining compatible with multiple governance interventions.</p>",

As people increasingly perform meaningful societal actions (e.g., making consumer choices or voting) through AI agents, this project addresses the risks of intermediation by AI companies that could control the hardware and software of consumers' decision-making. The project investigates whether fundamental rights are a suitable and effective legal framework for protecting individuals' interests in the integrity and loyalty of their AI agents. Key research questions include drawing lessons from other 'new generation' fundamental rights (such as digital privacy or informational self-determination), defining what protections a right to AI integrity should encompass (non-tampering, transparency, loyalty to the principal, freedom from manipulation, portability), providing normative justification for why constitutional protection is necessary beyond consumer protection and contract law, and exploring implementation pathways at constitutional, supranational (e.g., EU), or international levels. The theory of change posits that constitutional rights provide durable protections that consumer law cannot, addressing the principal-agent alignment problem at the societal level and ensuring that even if technical alignment succeeds, the benefits accrue to users rather than being captured by intermediary AI companies.</p>",
